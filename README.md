So this is a Math Game that I created from stackskills.com and this is just 1 of the many projects that I got from learning the Full Stack tutorial. 
I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well

Press Start Game to start the game.

You have 1 minute to pick the correct answer of the mouth questoin

Each correct answer is a point

After the 60 seconds is up then its' Game Over 

Then click Reset Game
